Project guidelines can be found below or [here!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cxY8QBaI0P1mKYRo9bSRES6WRLEweR6KyUjbV3RhMOw/edit?usp=sharing)
* Please note that the project requirements are still being finalized.
* Good examples of previous course projects can be found **[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZRZyWwDj6rYN6rbsNY9R363ZibgUhzNg?usp=drive_link)**. Note that the project requirements for the previous year were slightly different, so use their projects as a reference for ideas, but not length requirements!
