Hi everyone, I'm a new faculty member at UCSD and excited to be teaching COGS 180 this quarter! In this course, we’ll explore decision making from all the branches of cognitive science: neuroscience, psychology, design, ML, and more. You’re always welcome to come to my office hours to ask questions or just say hello. I’m looking forward to a great quarter together!
