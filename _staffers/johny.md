Hello everyone, my name is Johny and I will be one of your **PLAs** for this quarter. I'm a fourth-year Cognitive Science student specializing in Machine Learning. I am looking forward to working with you all with different approaches to modeling and data analysis. In my free time, I enjoy playing sports such as basketball and playing video games. If you have any questions about anything regarding this course or anything else, please don't hesitate to reach out!

**Weekly OHs:** During **Wednesday discussion section (2-3pm)** and **Wednesday, 12-1pm** on Zoom ([book here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ1WvcYtgNkM4YyT0kNVwXJozy4e8Q_38ggQFCpD8pPgP1ppncu73eGhm8SXFO1UgkTubgojQ5Vu)).
